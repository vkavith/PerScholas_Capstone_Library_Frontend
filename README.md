# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Table of Contents

## Why would you build this App
+ I can scale this App further and promote in my native city library and any small towns in India to access this Digital Library.The city or a small town library in India are not funded much by the Corporation, so can help the library which are in real need. Implement the same to Government funded schools where the infrastructure is not good. Help the library/schools in my native city in India which are less fortunate.
+ A fun toolkit for my young nephews to play with and checkout the children's category.
